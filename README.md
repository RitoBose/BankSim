BankSim (Online Bank Simulator)

 BankSim is an online banking system simulation that allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts.
 
 Users can deposit and withdraw money, transfer funds between accounts and recipients, add or edit recipients, view transaction histories, and schedule appointments.
 
 The system supports two roles: User and Admin. The admin panel, built with Angular 2, interacts with the backend via REST APIs.
 
 This project is containerized using Docker for seamless deployment.
